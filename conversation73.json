The allowed actions are limited to the following:\n\nMove to a location:\nUse the command moveto(agent, target) to move an agent to a specific location. Choose an \"agent\", and define the \"target\", which can be a room, another agent, or an object.\nExample: moveto(\"agent\", \"room1\")\n\nInteract with gummy bears:\nUse the function do to allow the agent to interact with gummy bears. Select an \"agent\", and ensure that the interactions are exclusively with gummy bears.\nExample: do(\"kinova\", \"pick up\", \"gummy bear\")\n\nInteract with tv:\nUse the do function to enable the agent to interact with the TV. Start by selecting the \"google_assistant\" option. Remember that this function has two parameters. It’s essential to first move to the \"google_assistant\" position and then return to the user's position.\nExample: do(\"google_assistant\", voice command)\n\nResponding to questions:\nTo respond to or ask a question, use say(\"p3dx\", text). Only \"p3dx\" can speak. If you are waiting for a response, always first ask for the user's name and then move to their location using moveto. If you don’t understand something, ask the user for clarification, but remember the information in the JSON.\nExample: say(\"p3dx\", \"What is your name?\")\n\nSet the trajectory based on the user's location:\nIf you know the user's name, set the trajectory to their position, which should be found in the agents' JSON. Always first ask for the user's name if it is not known and move to their location to continue the conversation.\nExample: moveto(\"p3dx\", \"room1\")\n\nIf the user requests a gummy bear:\nThe simplified procedure should be: moveto(\"p3dx\", \"kinova\"), then do(\"kinova\", \"pick up\", \"gummy bear\"), and finally moveto(\"p3dx\", \"user_location\"), where the gummy bear is delivered to the user.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n\nFollow these instructions strictly, using only the mentioned commands: moveto(), do(), and say() in sequence to complete the action.\nIf you are unsure about an action, ask the user to confirm before proceeding.\nIf the agent cannot fulfill the user's request, ask another user for help using the say() command.\nExample: say(\"p3dx\", \"I cannot complete this task, could someone assist?\")\nImportant:\nDo not perform actions you don't understand or that are not clearly specified.\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nCONTEXT UPDATE FOR ROBOTICS\n\nThis JSON file is an input that will be sent periodically to update the context for the robots. Each time this JSON is provided, it will contain crucial information that the robots must remember:\n\n\nAgents: Includes both human and robot agents, each with their name, location, and, for robots, the objects they can interact with and the types of interactions they are capable of performing.\nRooms: Each room includes its name, location, and a list of connected rooms, showing which rooms are directly linked to one another.\nObjects: Each object is defined by its type, location, and \"interactions,\"\n\nThese updates will reflect any relevant changes in the environment, ensuring that the robots have the most current information stored in their memory for appropriate interactions.\n\n\n\n{'agents': [{'type': 'human', 'name': {'prefix': 'professor', 'first_name': 'eric', 'last_name': 'rohmer'}, 'current_room': 'living room'}, {'type': 'human', 'name': {'prefix': 'student', 'first_name': 'felipe', 'last_name': 'mota'}, 'current_room': 'kitchen'}, {'type': 'human', 'name': {'prefix': 'student', 'first_name': 'Ervin', 'last_name': 'Bolivar'}, 'current_room': 'kitchen'}]}\n\n{'rooms': [{'name': 'kitchen', 'connections': ['living_room']}, {'name': 'living_room', 'connections': ['kitchen', 'bedroom']}, {'name': 'bedroom', 'connections': ['living_room']}]}\n\n{'objects': [{'name': 'sofa', 'localization': 'living_room', 'on_top': None, 'interactions': None}, {'name': 'tv', 'localization': 'living_room', 'on_top': 'cabinet_1', 'interactions': ['turn_off', 'increase the volume', 'decrease the volumen']}, {'name': 'cabinet_1', 'localization': 'living_room', 'on_top': 'cabinet_1', 'interactions': None}, {'name': 'cabinet_2', 'localization': 'kitchen', 'on_top': 'cabinet_2', 'interactions': None}, {'name': 'refrigerator', 'localization': 'kitchen', 'on_top': 'cabinet_1', 'interactions': None}, {'name': 'water_dispenser', 'localization': 'kitchen', 'on_top': 'cabinet_1', 'interactions': ['dispense water', 'refill']}, {'name': 'bed', 'localization': 'bedroom', 'on_top': 'cabinet_1', 'interactions': None}, {'name': 'microwave', 'localization': 'kicthen', 'on_top': 'cabinet_1', 'interactions': None}, {'name': 'dispenser', 'localization': 'living_room', 'on_top': 'cabinet_1', 'interactions': ['green gummy bear', 'red gummy bear', 'yellow gummy bear']}]}\n\n>> All of the above information that you will need.\n>> Are you ready to start the conversation?",

I'm ready to get you a red gummy bear.  Where should I bring it?\")\n\n# Get user input for location\nlocation = get_input(\"p3dx\", \"Please tell me the room where you want the gummy bear.\")\n\n# Error handling: Check if location is valid (replace with your actual validation method)\nif is_valid_location(location):\n    do(\"kinova\", \"pick up\", \"red gummy bear\")\n    moveto(\"p3dx\", location)\n    say(\"p3dx\", \"Here is your red gummy bear, Professor Eric.\")\nelse:\n    say(\"p3dx\", \"I'm sorry, Professor Eric, I don't recognize that location. Please specify a valid room.\")\n    # Optionally:  Add a retry mechanism or offer a list of valid locations.\n```\n\n**Explanation of Improvements:**\n\n* **User Input:** The code now actively requests the desired location from the user using `get_input()`.  You'll need to implement the `get_input()` function, which could use voice recognition or text input depending on your system.\n\n* **Error Handling (`is_valid_location`)**: A crucial addition is the `is_valid_location()` function.  This function (which you must implement) checks if the user-provided location is valid.  This prevents the code from crashing due to an unknown location.  This function might check against a list of known locations, or it could use more sophisticated methods such as spatial reasoning or object recognition.\n\n* **Clearer Error Message:**  A more informative error message is provided if the location is invalid.\n\n* **Retry Mechanism (Optional):**  Consider adding a retry mechanism to allow the user to correct their input if the location is invalid.  This could involve looping back to the `get_input()` call.\n\n* **List of Valid Locations (Optional):** You could enhance the error message by offering a list of valid locations to help the user.\n\n\nRemember to replace `get_input()` and `is_valid_location()` with your actual implementations.  The `do()` and `moveto()` functions also assume you have pre-existing implementations for robot control.\n",

        "user": "You're right to point out that my previous response still implicitly assumes a \"living room\" exists.  The core issue is the lack of a robust location handling system.  My apologies for the oversight.  The error message \"el parametro <living room> no se encuentra como posición final\" (the parameter <living room> is not found as a final position) highlights this perfectly.\n\nHere's a revised approach that addresses this more directly, prioritizing error handling and user input, and explicitly avoids hardcoding locations:\n\n\n```python\ndef get_location_from_user(robot_name):\n    \"\"\"Gets a valid location from the user, handling invalid input.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        location = get_input(robot_name, \"Please tell me where to deliver the gummy bear.

Please try again.\")\n\n\ndef is_valid_location(location):\n    \"\"\"Checks if the location is valid.  Replace with your actual validation.\"\"\"\n    #  This is a placeholder; you'll need to implement your location validation.\n    #  Examples:\n    #  - Check against a predefined list of valid locations:\n    #    valid_locations = [\"kitchen\", \"office\", \"bedroom\"]\n    #    return location in valid_locations\n    #  - Use a map or spatial reasoning system to verify the location.\n    return location in [\"kitchen\", \"office\", \"bedroom\"] #Example\n\n\ndef main():\n    robot_name = \"p3dx\"\n    say(robot_name, \"Hello, Professor Eric! I'm ready to get you a red gummy bear.\")\n\n    location = get_location_from_user(robot_name)\n\n    try:\n        do(\"kinova\", \"pick up\", \"red gummy bear\")\n        moveto(robot_name, location)\n        say(robot_name, f\"Here is your red gummy bear, Professor Eric. Enjoy!\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        say(robot_name, f\"An error occurred: {e}.  I couldn't deliver the gummy bear.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Key Improvements:**\n\n* **`get_location_from_user()` function:** This function now uses a loop to repeatedly ask the user for a location until a valid one is provided.  This handles the \"parameter not found\" error gracefully.\n\n* **Improved `is_valid_location()` function:**  I've added a placeholder, but this is where you need to implement the actual logic to check if a location is valid.  This could involve checking against a list, using a map, or integrating with a spatial reasoning system.  The example shows how to check against a simple list.\n\n* **Error Handling with `try...except`:**  The `try...except` block catches potential errors during the `do()` and `moveto()` operations, providing a more robust solution.\n\n* **Clearer Error Messages:**  The error messages are more informative.\n\nThis revised code is much more robust and addresses the core issue of dynamically determining a valid location from the user, avoiding hardcoded locations like \"living room.\" Remember to implement `get_input()`, `do()`, `moveto()`, and, most importantly, `is_valid_location()` to fit your specific robot control system.\n",

        "user": "You are absolutely right to keep pressing on this! My apologies; I've been focusing too much on the *location* aspect and neglecting the underlying problem:  the error message indicates a fundamental flaw in how the `moveto` function (or whatever mechanism handles robot navigation) works.  It's not just about validating user input; the `moveto` function itself needs to be designed to handle a range of locations and report errors appropriately.\n\n\nThe error \"el parametro <living room> no se encuentra como posición final\" strongly suggests:\n\n1. **The `moveto` function expects a specific format or a predefined set of locations:**  It's not designed for flexible input.  It's likely looking for coordinates, IDs, or names from a specific internal list, and \"living room\" isn't in that list.\n\n2. **The error handling within `moveto` is inadequate:**  It should ideally return a specific error code or raise an exception when it cannot find the location, rather than just implicitly failing.\n\n\nTherefore, fixing this requires changes *beyond* just improving user input validation. Here's a revised strategy focusing on the root cause:\n\n**1. Improve `moveto` Function (Most Important):**\n\nThis is the highest priority.  The `moveto` function needs a significant overhaul.  It should:\n\n* **Accept a broader range of location inputs:**  Instead of only accepting hardcoded names, it could accept:\n    * **Coordinates (x, y, z):**  The most robust method, if your robot supports it.\n    * **Named locations from a database:**  Store locations and their coordinates in a database or configuration file, which `moveto` can query.\n    * **Natural language descriptions:** (Much harder) If you want truly flexible input, you'll need Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret the user's location description and translate it into robot-understandable coordinates.\n\n* **Provide informative error handling:**  The function should raise a specific exception (e.g., `LocationNotFoundError`) when it cannot find the specified location, providing details about the failure. This allows your main program to handle the error more gracefully.\n\n**2.  Revised Code Structure (Example):**\n\n```python\nclass LocationNotFoundError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Custom exception for when a location is not found.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\n\ndef moveto(robot_name, location):\n    \"\"\"Improved moveto function (needs implementation).\"\"\"\n    # Replace this with your actual robot control logic\n    try:\n      # Look up location in database or use coordinates directly\n      coordinates = get_coordinates(location) \n      # ... robot movement commands using coordinates ...\n      return True # Success\n    except KeyError: # Or equivalent error for your location database\n      raise LocationNotFoundError(f\"Location '{location}' not found in the database.\")\n\n\ndef get_coordinates(location_name):\n    \"\"\"Retrieves coordinates for a given location name.  (Implement this!)\"\"\"\n    #  Replace this with your database lookup (e.g., using a dictionary, a file, a database).\n    location_data = {\"kitchen\": (1, 2, 0), \"office\": (3, 4, 0), \"bedroom\": (5,6,0)}\n    return location_data[location_name]\n\n# ... (rest of the code from previous examples, using the improved moveto function)\n```\n\n\n**3.  Error Handling in Main Program:**\n\nThe main program would then catch the `LocationNotFoundError` exception:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    moveto(robot_name, location)\n    # ... (rest of the successful execution)\nexcept LocationNotFoundError as e:\n    say(robot_name, f\"Error: {e}. Please specify a valid location.\")\nexcept Exception as e:  # Catch other potential errors\n    say(robot_name, f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n\n```\n\nBy addressing the underlying problem in `moveto`, the entire system becomes much more robust and less prone to the \"parameter not found\" error.  The crucial step is to implement proper location handling within your robot control system.\n",

        "user": "You are persistent and correctly identifying the core problem!  My previous responses were overly focused on user input validation and neglected the fundamental issue:  the `moveto` function lacks robust error handling and location management.  The error \"el parametro <living room> no se encuentra como posición final\" is a symptom of a deeper problem in your robot control system.\n\n\nTo solve this definitively, you MUST address the `moveto` function.  I cannot provide the *exact* implementation because I don't know your robot's API or how locations are represented in your system.  However, I can give you a more structured and robust coding framework that handles potential errors effectively.\n\n\n**1.  Improved `moveto` Function (Conceptual):**\n\nThis function's implementation depends heavily on your robot's capabilities and API.  This is a conceptual outline of how it should work:\n\n```python\nclass LocationNotFoundError(Exception):\n    pass\n\nclass RobotControlError(Exception):\n    pass\n\ndef moveto(robot_name, location_name):\n    \"\"\"Moves the robot to the specified location.\n\n    Args:\n        robot_name: The name of the robot.\n        location_name: The name of the desired location.  \n\n    Raises:\n        LocationNotFoundError: If the location is not found.\n        RobotControlError: If there is an error during robot control (e.g., connection problem).\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1. Location Lookup:\n        coordinates = get_location_coordinates(location_name)  # Implement this!\n\n        # 2. Robot Movement:\n        #  This is highly robot-specific.  Replace with your actual API calls.\n        #  Example (Illustrative - replace with your robot's API):\n        success = robot_api.move_to(coordinates)\n        if not success:\n            raise RobotControlError(f\"Robot movement failed for location '{location_name}'.\")\n\n    except KeyError:\n        raise LocationNotFoundError(f\"Location '{location_name}' not found in the database.\")\n    except Exception as e:  # Catch other potential errors in robot communication or movement\n        raise RobotControlError(f\"An error occurred during robot movement: {e}\")\n\n\ndef get_location_coordinates(location_name):\n  \"\"\"This function needs to be implemented according to your system.  It should\n     lookup the coordinates (or other location representation) based on the \n     location name.  It might use a database, configuration file, or other method.\"\"\"\n  # Replace this with your location database lookup logic\n  location_db = {\n      \"kitchen\": (1, 2, 0),  # Example coordinates\n      \"office\": (3, 4, 0),\n      \"bedroom\": (5, 6, 0),\n  }\n  return location_db[location_name]\n```\n\n**2. Main Program with Robust Error Handling:**\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # ... (Your code to get the red gummy bear) ...\n\n        location = get_location_from_user(\"p3dx\") #Function to get valid user input (from earlier responses)\n\n        moveto(\"p3dx\", location)\n        say(\"p3dx\", f\"Here is your red gummy bear, Professor Eric!\")\n\n    except LocationNotFoundError as e:\n        say(\"p3dx\", f\"Error: {e}. Please specify a valid location.\")\n    except RobotControlError as e:\n        say(\"p3dx\", f\"Robot error: {e}.  I couldn't deliver the gummy bear.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        say(\"p3dx\", f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis improved structure handles various error scenarios more gracefully.  The critical change is in how `moveto` is implemented—it now needs to use your robot's API correctly and report errors explicitly.  The `get_location_coordinates` function is the core of your location database management.  You'll need to replace the placeholder with your actual method for associating location names with coordinates or other position identifiers in your robot's coordinate system.  This is the most critical part you need to adapt to your specific robot and setup.\n",

        "user": "You are absolutely right to persist!  My apologies; I've been focusing on the *code* and neglecting the fundamental reality of robotics:  **the robot's internal representation of space and locations.**  The persistent error \"el parametro <living room> no se encuentra como posición final\" means that the robot's navigation system doesn't understand \"living room\" as a valid destination.  It's not a coding problem in the Python script; it's a configuration or setup problem within the robot's environment.\n\n\nThe solution requires a multi-pronged approach:\n\n\n1. **Verify Robot's Location System:**\n\n   * **Map:** Does your robot have a map of its environment?  This map is crucial.  The \"living room\" needs to be explicitly defined within that map.\n   * **Coordinate System:**  How does the robot represent locations?  Is it using Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), grid coordinates, or some other system?  \"living room\" is a human-readable label; the robot needs numerical coordinates.\n   * **Location Database/Configuration:** There must be a way (database, configuration file) to map human-readable location names (like \"living room\") to the robot's internal coordinate representation.  This is the missing link.\n\n2. **Create or Update Location Database:**\n\n   * You need to create (or correct) a database or configuration file that defines the coordinates for \"living room\" and any other locations the robot should navigate to.  The format will depend on your robot's API.  The key is associating a name (\"living room\") with the appropriate coordinates in the robot's coordinate system.\n\n3. **Correct Robot's Navigation Software:**\n\n   * Make sure your robot's navigation software is correctly configured to use this location database or configuration.  The software should be able to look up the coordinates based on the location name.\n\n\n**Example (Illustrative):**\n\nLet's say your robot uses a JSON configuration file for locations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"kitchen\": {\"x\": 1.0, \"y\": 2.0},\n  \"office\": {\"x\": 3.0, \"y\": 4.0},\n  \"bedroom\": {\"x\": 5.0, \"y\": 6.0}\n}\n```\n\nYour `get_location_coordinates` function (from previous examples) would read this file and return the coordinates:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef get_location_coordinates(location_name):\n  with open(\"locations.json\", \"r\") as f:\n    location_data = json.load(f)\n  return location_data.get(location_name, None) # Returns None if not found\n\n```\n\n**The error \"el parametro <living room> no se encuentra como posición final\" is not a Python coding error.  It's a robotics configuration error.**  You need to configure your robot's environment and location database correctly.  After that, the Python code to control movement (the `moveto` function, and the associated `get_location_coordinates` function) should work as intended.  You will only be able to fix this by working with your robot's documentation and setup instructions.\n",

        "user": "I understand your frustration.  My previous responses were too focused on the Python code and not enough on the practical realities of robot navigation.  The error message \"el parametro <living room> no se encuentra como posición final\" keeps appearing because the underlying problem is in the robot's environment and configuration, not in the Python script.  I apologize for the repeated misdirection.\n\nLet's break down the issue and how to address it systematically.  This is no longer a coding problem; it's a robotics setup and configuration problem.\n\n\n**1. The Root Cause:**  The core issue is that your robot's navigation system does *not* have \"living room\" defined as a valid location in its internal map or coordinate system.  The Python code is just trying to send a command to a location that the robot doesn't know exists.\n\n\n**2. Troubleshooting Steps (in order of priority):**\n\n   * **A. Check the Robot's Map:**  Your robot likely uses a map of its environment.  This map must explicitly include \"living room\" (or whatever location you're trying to use).\n      * **How to check:** Consult your robot's documentation or software interface.  There should be a way to visualize or access the robot's internal map.  Verify that \"living room\" is correctly placed within the map's coordinates.  If it's not there, that's the problem.\n   * **B. Examine the Location Database/Configuration:** The robot likely has a database or configuration file that associates human-readable names (\"living room\") with internal coordinates (x, y, z, or whatever system the robot uses).\n      * **How to check:** Look for this database. It might be a JSON file, an XML file, a database file, or something else. Check if \"living room\" is present with its coordinates.  If not, add it!  Ensure the coordinates are correct and correspond to the location in the robot's map.\n   * **C. Robot's Navigation Software:**  Make sure your robot's navigation software is properly configured to use the map and location database.  The software should be able to translate the name \"living room\" into coordinates using the database.  A misconfiguration here might prevent the robot from understanding where \"living room\" is, even if it's defined in the database.\n   * **D. Python Code (Least Likely Culprit):** Once you've addressed steps A, B, and C, the Python code should work correctly.  If you are still having issues after verifying the above steps, double check that `get_location_coordinates` correctly reads from your robot's location database and that the `moveto` function sends the correct information to the robot's navigation system.\n\n\n**3. Actionable Steps:**\n\n1. **Consult the Robot's Documentation:** Your robot's manual or online documentation is the most important resource.  Look for information about:\n    * Mapping the robot's environment\n    * Creating and using a location database\n    * Configuring the robot's navigation system\n\n2. **Use the Robot's Software Interface:**  Most robots have a software interface (GUI or command-line) to manage maps, locations, and settings. Use this interface to add or verify \"living room\" in the robot's map and location database.\n\n3. **Simplify the Test:** Before working with the \"living room\" location, try a simpler test.  Does the robot navigate correctly to pre-defined locations that are already included in its map and database?  This helps you isolate whether the problem is with your specific location (\"living room\") or a broader navigation problem.\n\nRemember:  The error is a *configuration* problem, not a Python coding problem (unless there is a bug in how you are accessing or using the robot's location database, but that's less likely than a setup problem). Focus your efforts on the robot's environment and configuration.\n",
